# ASA-DATAFEST-2023

## This is our award-winning presentation at the 2023 UCLA ASA DATAFEST. The data was provided by the American Bar Association. Our original goal was to develop a numerical metric to rate lawyer's performance and client satisfaction, leading to a practical analysis to improve client-lawyer match rate and overall user experience. 

## After cleaning out the text data and running a predictive sentiment model to give each text a positivity score, we were able to draw some general findings:
- Most states showed an increase in positivity after receiving a lawyer's reply, EXCEPT Kansas
- Faster response does not necessarily lead to better sentiment level (content quality may be more important then efficiency)
- Shorter lawyer replies tend to yield a better user response rate and sentiment level (Clients prefer concise answers over complicated ones)

## However, after analyzing the clients' interaction with lawyers, we discovered a more vital problem within the system: From signing up an account to getting the question answered, each stage involved a massive user churn. Based on our findings, we constructed a 5-level funnel model to analyze user churn and provided constructive solutions to each stage:
- Registration: Most users were denied access to an account because they entered Null as their income, while the primary users of the system were low-income households. Solution: Detailed income investigation.
- Question Posting: There is a mismatch of lawyers' expertise and clients' needs (Family,Children, and Housing were the most popular categories while they have the least answering rates.) Solution: Recruit and allocate lawyers according to the needs identified.
- Receiving Answer: Each post will automatically close after 10 days, but the average lawyer replying time for most categories is over 10 days. Solution: extend the closing date and enforce monitor program that prioritize older posts.
- Follow-up: Most conversations ended after the legal end date of clients' trials, meaning they never got to utilize the advice from the platform. Solution: enhance user response rate based on findings from the first section, add a rating system after each consultation and track user retention rate for better future analysis.

## With our findings and solutions, our team achieved the Award for Best User Experience.
